## Journey to the Sun

A long time ago on a tiny, far away island lived a boy named Nainoa. 

Every morning Nainoa would wake up early, run from his home, through the streets, to a beach on the east side of the island to watch the sun raise. " Where does the sun come from?" he would think "I would like to know." Once the sun had risen and the day had begun Nainoa would climb a near by coconut tree,  pick a young coconut for his breakfast and run back home.

In the early evening when Nainoa had finished his homework and finished dinner; Naiona would hop on his bike, and race from his home, through the streets to a beach on the west side of the island and watch the sunset. 

 "where does the sun go?" he would think "I would like to know."
Once the sun had set and the day was done he would ride back home, get in bed and fall asleep.

One morning as Nainoa was running through the streets ,he bummed into a merchant as she opened her store.

"And Where are you running to so quickly, lighting boy?" The merchant asked. "I am going to see the sunrise" he said ecstatically. Then he whispered "One day I am going to sail on the sea and find the place where the sun 
rises? 

The merchant was impressed by his vigor. "Do you have a boat?" She asked. "No"said Nainoa. "Do you have a paddle?" She asked. "No" said Nainoa. "Do you have a crew?" She asked. "No" said Nainoa. The merchant could see that her line of questioning had saddened the boy. "Maybe I can help you" she said

She went in to he store and came back with the most beautiful Koa paddle Nainoa had ever seen. She handed it to him and whispered "go see the sun." 

Nainoa's eyes were large with surprise. He took off to the beach yelling "Thank you, thank you very much!"

That evening as he was biking, he was stopped by a neighbor tending his garden "where are you going so fast wind-chaser?" 
I am going to see the sunset" he said ecstatically. Then he whispered "One day I am going to sail on the sea and find the place where the sunsets? 

The gardener was heartened by his enthusiasm . "Do you have a boat?" He asked. "No"said Nainoa. "Do you have a paddle?" He asked. "Yes" said Nainoa proudly. "Do you have a crew?" He asked. "No" said Nainoa. The gardener could see that his line of questioning had saddened the boy slightly. "Maybe I can help you" he said.

The gardener went in to his shed and came out with a tny sapling. His instructions were very clear: " plant this in a place that gets good light and where it will not be disturbed." Also "once you plant it whisper a wish, and from this plant shall grow that wish" 

Nainoa was speechless for a moment , but as he rode off on his bike he  yelled " thank, thank you so much"

Naina hurriedly got to the Beach to watch the setting sun. When it was finished he planted the sapling in the sand and whispered "help me find the place where the sunsets" and with that he headed home.

The next morning he ran with his paddle to watch the rising sun...as usual. 

In the evening he biked to watch it set.  Hle found the sapling had fruited the largest coconut he had seen. 

It was so big he didn't know how he was going to get it down. Just then a group of boys was passing by. Nainoa called to them . " friends I need your help . This is my coconut , but I have no way to get it down . Can you help me?" 

The boys were amazed at its size! "What's in it for us?" One of them asked. "This is too much for me to carry home so I'll split it with you ." The boys agreed and went to work shucking and splitting the giant coconut.

Once the nut had been split coconut poured out all over the sand . The boys began devouring their half . "What are you going to do with yours" they asked. Nainoa knew instantly " I'm going to sail to the place where the sunsets." He replied 

The boys' curiosity was perked. "Do you have a boat?" They asked. "Yes" said Nainoa. "Do you have a paddle?" They asked. "Yes" said Nainoa. "Do you have a crew?" They asked. "No" said Nainoa. The boys could see Nainoa was not afraid to journey on his own, which meant he was either very brave or very crazy. 

" if you can find where the sunsets and return home you'll  have yourself a crew" all the boys agreed. But Nainoa was confused " if I find the setting sun what do I need a crew for?" he asked "To help you count every star in the sky" they said

Nainoa agreed. He jumped in to his coconut boat and paddled in to the sea. 

Much time passed. Days, months, even years. Nainoa's family became very sad. They thought that the boy who so loved the sea had been consumed by it. 

Then an outrigger came ashore on the beach. It had a large mast with several sails, a float on one side and it was made out of a coconut. A man jumped from the boat on to shore.

"Where's my crew?!" He bellowed "we've got a lot of stars to count."
