## Journey to the Sun

A long time ago on a tiny, far away island lived a boy named Nainoa. 

Every morning Nainoa would wake up early, run from his home, through the streets, to a beach on the east side of the island to watch the sun raise. " Where does the sun come from?" he would think "I would like to know." Once the sun had risen and the day had begun Nainoa would climb a near by coconut tree,  pick a young coconut for his breakfast and run back home.

In the early evening when Nainoa had finished his homework and finished dinner; Naiona would hop on his bike, and race from his home, through the streets to a beach on the west side of the island and watch the sunset. 

 "where does the sun go?" he would think "I would like to know."
Once the sun had set and the day was done he would ride back home, get in bed and fall asleep.

One morning as Nainoa was running through the streets ,he bummed into a merchant as she opened her store.

"And Where are you running to so quickly, lighting boy?" The merchant asked. "I am going to see the sunrise" he said ecstatically. Then he whispered "One day I am going to sail on the sea and find the place where the sun 
rises? 

The merchant was impressed by his vigor. "Do you have a boat?" She asked. "No"said Nainoa. "Do you have a paddle?" She asked. "No" said Nainoa. "Do you have a crew?" She asked. "No" said Nainoa. The merchant could see that her line of questioning had saddened the boy. "Maybe I can help you" she said

She went in to he store and came back with the most beautiful Koa paddle Nainoa had ever seen. She handed it to him and whispered "go see the sun." 

Nainoa's eyes were large with surprise. He took off to the beach yelling "Thank you, thank you very much!"

That evening as he was biking, he was stopped by a neighbor tending his garden "where are you going so fast wind-chaser?" 
I am going to see the sunset" he said ecstatically. Then he whispered "One day I am going to sail on the sea and find the place where the sunsets? 

The gardener was heartened by his enthusiasm . "Do you have a boat?" He asked. "No"said Nainoa. "Do you have a paddle?" He asked. "Yes" said Nainoa proudly. "Do you have a crew?" He asked. "No" said Nainoa. The gardener could see that his line of questioning had saddened the boy slightly. "Maybe I can help you" he said.

The gardener went in to his shed and came out with a tny sapling. His instructions were very clear: " plant this in a place that gets good light and where it will not be disturbed." Also "once you plant it whisper a wish, and from this plant shall grow that wish" 

Nainoa was speechless for a moment , but as he rode off on his bike he  yelled " thank, thank you so much"

Naina hurriedly got to the Beach to watch the setting sun. When it was finished he planted the sapling in the sand and whispered "help me find the place where the sunsets" and with that he headed home.

The next morning he ran with his paddle to watch the rising sun...as usual. 

In the evening he biked to watch it set.  Hle found the sapling had fruited the largest coconut he had seen. 

It was so big he didn't know how he was going to get it down. Just then a group of boys was passing by. Nainoa called to them . " friends I need your help . This is my coconut , but I have no way to get it down . Can you help me?" 

The boys were amazed at its size! "What's in it for us?" One of them asked. "This is too much for me to carry home so I'll split it with you ." The boys agreed and went to work shucking and splitting the giant coconut.

Once the nut had been split coconut poured out all over the sand . The boys began devouring their half . "What are you going to do with yours" they asked. Nainoa knew instantly " I'm going to sail to the place where the sunsets." He replied 

The boys' curiosity was perked. "Do you have a boat?" They asked. "Yes" said Nainoa. "Do you have a paddle?" They asked. "Yes" said Nainoa. "Do you have a crew?" They asked. "No" said Nainoa. The boys could see Nainoa was not afraid to journey on his own, which meant he was either very brave or very crazy. 

" if you can find where the sunsets and return home you'll  have yourself a crew" all the boys agreed. But Nainoa was confused " if I find the setting sun what do I need a crew for?" he asked "To help you count every star in the sky" they said

Nainoa agreed. He jumped in to his coconut boat and paddled in to the sea. 

Much time passed. Days, months, even years. Nainoa's family became very sad. They thought that the boy who so loved the sea had been consumed by it. 

Then an outrigger came ashore on the beach. It had a large mast with several sails, a float on one side and it was made out of a coconut. A man jumped from the boat on to shore.

"Where's my crew?!" He bellowed "we've got a lot of stars to count."

##Dad and the slow motion spanking

There are three boys in my family: Roberto, 15, stocky. Me, 10, rounded and Xavier, 6, lean and just as tall as me. 
So One night Roberto says "yo, I'm going to the movies, you want to come?" 

Of course I say. I ahout to my parents who are down the hall, in the living room out of sight of the proceedings amazingly they say yes 
so Xav steps up and says "I want to go" An idea immediately shot down by my Mom. Xav wasn't happy.

Roberto says firmly with "no Xav, its rated R, and you're too young to see those kinds of movies" 

now granted I'M too young to see those kinds of movies but I had an excellent track record of no bed wetting, nightmares, abnormally aggressive behavior, violent play or any other indicator that the fantasy/reality line was blurred, so I'm good!

Ladies and gentlemen, let me draw your attention to one very significant point. At this moment...I've won. Not only am I going to a rated R movie, on a school night with my older brother , but Xavier can't. In the annuals of sibling rivalry this is a tick in my favor...but it's not enough . Sadly I can't simply allow him to lose, I had to have a hand in crushing him. And that was my undoing. 

Xav start going back and forth "I want to go!" ,"YOU CANT GO!" 
"On second thought" my Dad says " Roberto why don't you take both of them and see a G movie instead." 
And just like that I lost, tick taken away

Our fighting only grew. Verbal jabs became shoves, next thing we're wrestling with Dad shouting threats from the living room for us to stops 

Suddenly, all sound seemed to be sucked from the space and time moved in slow motion. I gaze down the hall and see my Dad coming around the corner looking like an Olympic sprinter. High knees, pumping his arms with his game face, or in this case ass whooping face on.

Xav and I begin to panic like drug dealers in a creak house during a raid. I don't try to run. As a child of black parents I know running always makes it worse. I drop to the ground, cover my head and wait for lighting to strike. 

He's on top of us in what seemed like three steps. Peeking under my raised elbow I see my dad passing me by heading for Xav, who was making a break for his room at the end of the hall. Ha, kids, He didn't make it. With a running form which mirrored my father's, Xav gets one stride then he is hoisted up in the air by his left wrist Xav get a slap the butt so hard he contracts in to the fetal position. My Dad then released Xav in mid air and turned to me. 

I watched in awe. Amazed by my dads speed and frightened by his power, I am frozen in my crouch position. Seeing the open hall in front of me I get an ounce of Xav's bravery or maybe stupidityand make a run for it, keeping my hands close to my sides so as to not suffer the same fate. Suddenly the collar on my shirt becomes tight as if caught on a hook. I try to think fast but my thought is interrupted by a jolt and then a searing pain  emanating from my butt. It quickly spread to my legs and I know I am undone.

As Xav and I hit the ground at the same time. The world seemed to quickly regain it's normal speed. The sound of our wails and Cries filled the air.
My Dad looked at Roberto and say "Go."
Xav and I are left to lick our wounds 
That never happened again.
